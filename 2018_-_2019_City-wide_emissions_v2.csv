Essas concentrações foram consideradas nos cálculos e aplicadas ao total de cada combustível verificado para o município, de acordo com os desenvolvimentos regulatórios do setor. Emissões de GEE para o consumo de eletricidade - As emissões indiretas de CO2 por consumo de eletricidade foram calculadas levando-se em consideração o fator de emissão médio do Sistema Interligado Nacional em cada ano do período considerado. Emissões de GEE por tratamento e lançamento de efluentes líquidos - Belo Horizonte possui 4 ETARs em operação, que emitem metano e óxido nitroso.Há uma quinta ETE que emprega processos físico-químicos que não emitem gases de efeito estufa. Uma fração do esgoto coletado em Belo Horizonte não é encaminhada para nenhuma estação de tratamento, sendo depositada diretamente no corpo d'água; outra fração de esgoto, que não é coletada, é presumivelmente tratada em sistemas sépticos (fossas sépticas), seguida de infiltração. Emissões de GEE por tratamento de resíduos sólidos urbanos - Aterro - Os resíduos sólidos gerados em Belo Horizonte são levados para disposição em aterro sanitário (CTR Macaúbas), onde não há sistema de recuperação de biogás. Assumiu-se que 100% do biogás gerado em resíduos sólidos urbanos em massa é liberado na atmosfera. Uma fração do lixo coletado na cidade ainda está disposta ao centro de tratamento maciço CTR-BR-040, em Belo Horizonte, em uma área separada onde, a partir de 2010, iniciou um sistema de geração termelétrica a partir do biogás gerado no aterro. Assim, o biogás derivado do antigo resíduo maciço não deve ser considerado no inventário de GEE a partir de 2010. É considerado apenas a fração derivada das provisões em área separada recente e não coberta pelo sistema de recuperação de biogás. Vale ressaltar que, de acordo com este modelo de decaimento de primeira ordem, para fins deste inventário, adotamos um período de 10 (dez) anos como degradação do horizonte de resíduos dentro do maciço.

In this way, the results described in the following chapters are intended to be comparable and acceptable on a global scale.The inventory prepared at the urban scale includes all the emission sources within the realm of authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality. The authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality covers the provincial boundaries of the province .The inventory content is based on the classification of emission sources set by GPC. When preparing inventory in the framework of GPC, the scope of the inventory was determined depending on the detail, accuracy and reliability of the available data. GPC evaluates greenhouse gas emissions in 3 scopes; Scope 1 - Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Indirect (Consumption Based) Emissions. During the preparation of the inventory, all emission sources within the realm of authority of the municipality were scanned and the maximum amount of data was tried to be reached. The emissions under Scope 3 were not included in the inventory due to the fact that it is ver y difficult to reach related data . According to the results of the GPC approach, the total greenhouse gas emissions of Denizli province for the year 2016 were estimated to be 7.5 million tons of CO2e. This amount refers to 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita, which is proportional to the population of Denizli in the same year (1.005.687) and this number is higher than Turkey’s 2016 average calculated as 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita. Total emissions of Denizli in Turkey’s total emissions in 2016 constitute 1.5%.",No,"CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6",,,,,,,5851890,1650777,0,5094537,7502667,,,,1027782,2018,,2020-01-12T04:30:42.857,,,,,2042,5094537,5,521935084,6.2
